## **Conclusion**

The successful migration from Siemens S7-300 to S7-1500 PLCs, along with the transition from Simatic Manager to TIA Portal V19, marked a significant technological upgrade across all three production linesâ€”Front Wall, Sub-Structure, and Main Framing. This modernization effort not only improved system reliability and performance but also laid the groundwork for future expansion and integration.

The addition of the AC Cowl model further enhanced the flexibility of the production system, enabling it to handle multiple product variants with minimal manual intervention. Communication challenges, drive configuration losses, and time constraints were addressed through structured planning, updated hardware, and rigorous testing.

Overall, the project delivered:

- Improved processing speed and diagnostics with the S7-1500 platform.
- Streamlined programming and configuration through TIA Portal.
- Enhanced production capabilities with model-based logic integration.
- Better communication reliability via upgraded CM PTP modules.

This migration initiative has strengthened the automation infrastructure, reduced maintenance complexity, and increased the scalability of the system for future upgrades and digital transformation goals.
